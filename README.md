# Finance
Financial Calculations in Python
==============================

What Is This?
-------------

These are collections of modules to perform different complex financial calculations in Python 3.6+. Each module represents the calculation it represents. I prefer to write clean but efficient and easy to understand code with all necessary docstrings.

Simulations

-Monte Carlo

How To Use This
---------------

1. You must have Python 3.6+ environment setup on your machine.
2. Download or clone https://github.com/afzal-xyz/Finance.git
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies
4. Run `python main.py`
5. This will run MonteCarlo Simulations in both in single process as well as in multi-threaded environment and shows you both timings as follows (your numbers can be different, but you should get lower time for multi-threaded run):

`MP--- 0.003989458084106445 seconds for non-parallel monte carlo simulations---`

`MP--- 0.0020351409912109375 seconds for parallel monte carlo simulations---`
